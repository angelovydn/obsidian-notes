An instruction set is all the commands a processor can execute.

Different *instruction set architectures* have different instruction sets, e.g. ARM and x86. 
Different *microarchitectures* may share an instruction set, e.g. Intel Core and AMD Ryzen.

A microarchitecture is a different implementation of an instruction set architecture.

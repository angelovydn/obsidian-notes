#arithmetic 
### Algebra
Algebra is a set of operators and values.
Operators are also called functions.
Operands are also called arguments.

Operators can be *overloaded*, or have different (*semantics*) in different algebras.
1010(10) + 0110(10) = 1120(10)
1010(2) + 0110(2) = 10000(2)
1010(bool) + 0110(bool) = 1110(bool)
- boolean algebra is not base 2 algebra
